### Traffic Analysis & Optimization

In this section I used MySQL to analyze where our website traffic is coming from, how different sources perform in terms of traffic volume and conversion rates, and how we can adjust bids to optimize our budgets.



### Website Measurement & Testing

In this section I dived into page-level website data to compare traffic and conversion rates, and used MySQL to build and analyze conversion funnels to help optimize the customer purchase experience.



### Channel Analysis & Optimization

In this section I digged deeper into our traffic channel mix, explore paid vs. free traffic, break down performance by device type, and write advanced SQL queries to conduct some time-series analyses to understand trending and seasonality.



### Product-Level Analysis

In this section I used MySQL to break down product-level sales and conversion rates, analyze cross-selling patterns, and use refund rates to keep a pulse on quality.



### User-Level Analysis

In this section I took a closer look at user behavior and repeat sessions, and use MySQL techniques to identify our most valuable customers and explore which channels they are coming from.
